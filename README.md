# About this repository

This repository contains samples of code that I wrote and documented for self-paced online trainings that I completed in my spare time. For each of these samples, I was only required to write the code to complete the training. However, I also documented the code to prove my ability to do so because reference documentation isn't something that I get to do in my current role.
